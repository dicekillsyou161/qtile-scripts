# qtile-scripts
personal qtile config scripts so that I can deploy my current setup more easily and can recover from problems with less pain.

Anyone who happens to find a bug or other some such thing, please feel free to leave a comment, I am somewhat of a beginner with QTile and python, so down for any help I can get :)


To-Do:
  Dependency Install Script

Stub for later expansion.
